# WeThinkCode_ – Week 0 Prep Journey

Hey there 

Welcome to my repository. I’m currently a student at WeThinkCode_, and this is where I’ll be tracking my learning and progress throughout the 9-week pre-academic prep plan.

## Week 0 – Getting Into the Flow

Week 0 was a mix of excitement and confusion. I’ve never coded before, so getting started with terminal commands, VS Code, Python, and Git felt a bit overwhelming at first. But I pushed through — slowly, and with a lot of trial and error.

Some things I struggled with:
- Navigating GitHub at first — it’s not as intuitive as it looks 
- Understanding the flow of Python input/output
- Figuring out how to structure my `.py` files correctly

But the more I practiced, the more things started to click.

## Tools & Concepts I’ve Learned So Far

- Using `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` from the terminal
- Creating and editing Python files in VS Code
- Understanding how functions like `input()` and `float("")` work
- Using string methods like `.lower()`
- Running my code from the terminal (and fixing errors when it doesn’t run)

## Peer-to-Peer Learning 

One of the best parts of this journey so far has been connecting with others in the same boat. We noticed a few of us were struggling with the same things, so I decided to create a study plan and 2 members volunteered to be the peer tutors. 

As of Wednesday, 9 July 2025, we’ve already had two sessions, and the response from the group has been amazing. People are showing up, asking questions, sharing resources, and helping each other out. It honestly makes the learning feel less lonely and way more manageable.

## What I’m Working On Next

- Getting more comfortable with GitHub and version control
- Practicing more Python exercises (especially conditionals and loops)
- Keeping the momentum going with the study group
- Helping others while also improving my own understanding
